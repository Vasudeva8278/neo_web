## 🛠️ Testing Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm** installed
2. **Development server** running on port 4000
3. **Playwright** for automated testing (will be installed automatically)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the development server
npm start

# Run mobile responsiveness tests
npm run test:mobile

# Run tests with browser visible
npm run test:mobile:headed

# Run tests in interactive UI mode
npm run test:mobile:ui
```

## 📋 Testing Methods

### 1. Manual Testing

#### Using the Manual Test Interface

1. **Open the test interface**:
   ```bash
   # Open mobile-test.html in your browser
   open mobile-test.html
   ```

2. **Test different viewport sizes**:
   - Use browser developer tools (F12)
   - Set device emulation to different mobile devices
   - Test at: 320px, 375px, 414px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px

3. **Follow the checklist**:
   - Navigation width and behavior
   - Content layout and spacing
   - Touch target sizes
   - Typography and readability

#### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigation sidebar is 48px wide on mobile
- [ ] Navigation text labels are hidden on mobile
- [ ] Navigation icons are 12px on mobile

- [ ] Template cards display in single column on mobile
- [ ] All interactive elements are at least 44px tall
- [ ] Text is readable on mobile devices
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on mobile
- [ ] Smooth transitions between breakpoints

### 2. Automated Testing

#### Running Playwright Tests

```bash
# Run all mobile responsiveness tests
npm run test:playwright

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/mobile-responsiveness.spec.js

# Run tests for specific browser
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"

# Run tests with debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate and view test report
npm run test:playwright:report
```

#### Test Categories Covered

   - Label visibility on different screen sizes
   - Icon size validation
   - Profile image scaling

2. **Layout and Content Tests**
   - Content area margin adjustments
   - Grid layout responsiveness
   - Spacing and padding verification

3. **Breakpoint Tests**
   - Mobile breakpoint (≤640px)
   - Tablet breakpoint (641px-1024px)
   - Desktop breakpoint (>1024px)

4. **Touch and Interaction Tests**
   - Touch target size validation
   - Clickability verification
   - Form input optimization

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Page load times
   - CSS loading verification
   - Console error checking

## 🎮 Test Runner Options

### Using the Custom Test Runner

```bash
# Basic test run
node run-mobile-tests.js

# Run with browser visible
node run-mobile-tests.js --headed

# Interactive UI mode
node run-mobile-tests.js --ui

# Debug mode
node run-mobile-tests.js --debug

# Specific browser project
node run-mobile-tests.js --project="Mobile Safari"

# Different reporter
node run-mobile-tests.js --reporter=json

# Show help
node run-mobile-tests.js --help
```

### Available Browser Projects

- **chromium**: Desktop Chrome
- **firefox**: Desktop Firefox
- **webkit**: Desktop Safari
- **Mobile Chrome**: Android Chrome (Pixel 5)
- **Mobile Safari**: iOS Safari (iPhone 12)

## 📊 Test Results and Reports

### HTML Report
After running tests, an HTML report is automatically generated:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### JSON Report
For CI/CD integration:
```bash
node run-mobile-tests.js --reporter=json
```

### Screenshots and Videos
- Screenshots are captured on test failures
- Videos are recorded for failed tests
- Traces are available for debugging

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Playwright Browser Not Found
```bash
# Install browsers
npx playwright install

# Install with system dependencies
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

#### 2. Development Server Not Running
```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:4000
```

#### 3. Tests Timing Out
- Increase timeout in playwright.config.js
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure sufficient system resources

#### 4. Element Not Found Errors
- Add data-testid attributes to components
- Update selectors in test files
- Check if elements are properly rendered

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging:
```bash
# Run single test in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug tests/mobile-responsiveness.spec.js

# Run with trace viewer
npx playwright test --trace on
```
